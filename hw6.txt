Why do we call the place we put stashes a "stack"? What git stash operation can we do that is usually impossible with stacks?

- It is called as stack because it works like stacks. Everytime you save a new stash, it is added on top of the existing stack.

Explain how you could use stashing to solve this problem if all you wanted to do was to checkout githw6, examine B.txt

- You can stash you changes and apply them later on any branch you want.
